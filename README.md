# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

We are <b>handairupa</b>, your personal skincare assistant.
<br>
This repo contains all of our files and steps needed to replicate it.
<br>
<br>
## Machine Learning
We used <a href=https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dinartas/skin90>skin90</a> from Kaggle as the dataset.
<br>
Model is created for image classification using transfer learning from InceptionV3. 
<br>
Model is trained with k-fold cross validation, reaching 84% accuracy (our set threshold). Refer to the model_training.ipynb file inside the ML folder for complete documentation.
<br>
We used FastAPI for deployment.
