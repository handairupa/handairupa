# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

We are <b>handairupa</b>, your personal skincare assistant.

This repo contains all of our files and steps needed to replicate it.

## Machine Learning
We used <a href=https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dinartas/skin90>skin90</a> from Kaggle as the dataset.
<br>
Model is created for image classification using transfer learning from InceptionV3. Refer to the model_training.ipynb file in the ML folder.

We used Vertex AI for deployment, choosing the 4-core CPU only option from a server located in Singapore.
